        <p>NISAR will be the first radar of its kind in space to systematically map Earth, using two different radar
            frequencies (L-band and S-band) to measure changes of our planet’s surface, including movements as small as
            centimeter. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) refers to a technique for producing fine-resolution images from a
            resolution-limited radar system.</p>

                    Human populations are increasing in high-risk areas vulnerable to sea level change, land subsidence, tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes and landslides. These hazards already cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damage every year. Improved forecasting and mitigation necessitate understanding these natural hazards, with measurements throughout the hazard cycle.</p>

                <p class="center">Many hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic unrest subtly change and deform the land surface before they become catastrophes. The best way to properly prepare for, mitigate and respond to nature’s disasters is to detect, measure and understand these slow-moving processes before they either trigger a major disaster or compromise our natural resources. This requires relevant, comprehensive, details, and accessible observations of subtle but detectable motions, collected over time.</p>

                <p class="center">Natural disasters often occur abruptly and without notice. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and landslides are sudden events that can cause billions of dollars in damage and extensive loss of life. Subsidence from water, oil or gas withdrawal from the ground and underground dissolution of limestone can have major impacts on agriculture, levees and our built environment.</p>

        <h2 class="h-secondary center">Mission Concept</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            NISAR is the first satellite mission to collect radar data in two microwave bandwidth regions, called the
            L-band and the S-band, to measure changes of our planet’s surface, including movements as small as
            centimeter. This allows the mission to observe a wide range of Earth processes, from the flow rates of
            glaciers and ice sheets to the dynamics of earthquakes and volcanoes.

            NISAR uses a sophisticated information-processing technique known as synthetic aperture radar to produce
            extremely high-resolution images. Radar penetrates clouds and darkness, enabling NISAR to collect data day
            and night in any weather. The instrument's imaging swath — the width of the strip of data collected along
            the length of the orbit track — is greater than 150 miles (240 kilometers), which allows it to image the
            entire Earth in 12 days.

            Over the course of multiple orbits, the radar images will allow users to track changes in croplands and
            hazard sites, as well as to monitor ongoing crises such as volcanic eruptions. The images will be detailed
            enough to show local changes and broad enough to measure regional trends. As the mission continues for
            years, the data will allow for better understanding of the causes and consequences of land surface changes,
            increasing our ability to manage resources and prepare for and cope with global change.

            NISAR is planned to launch in 2024 from India’s Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, India, into a
            near-polar orbit. NASA requires a minimum of three years of global science operations with the L-band radar,
            and ISRO requires five years of operations with the S-band radar over specified target areas in India and
            the Southern Ocean.

            All NISAR science data, L-band and S-band, will be freely available and open to the public, consistent with
            the long-standing NASA Earth Science open data policy. NASA has chosen the Alaska Satellite Facility
            Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) to host the mission’s data and products.</p>

        <h2 class="h-secondary center">Observatory</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The NISAR spacecraft will accommodate two fully capable synthetic aperture radar instruments (24 cm
            wavelength L-SAR and 10 cm wavelength S-SAR), each designed as array-fed reflectors to work as SweepSAR
            scan-on-receive wide swath mapping systems. The spacecraft will launch on an ISRO GSLV-II launch vehicle
            into a polar sun-synchronous dawn dusk orbit.

            NASA contributions include the L-band SAR instrument, including the 12-m diameter deployable mesh reflector
            and 9-m deployable boom and the entire octagonal instrument structure. In addition, NASA is providing a high
            capacity solid-state recorder (approximately 9 Tbits at end of life), GPS, 3.5 Gbps Ka-band telecom system,
            and an engineering payload to coordinate
            command and data handling with the ISRO spacecraft control systems. ISRO is providing the spacecraft and
            launch vehicle, as well as the S-band SAR electronics to be mounted on the instrument structure.

            The NISAR system comprises a dual frequency, fully polarimetric radar, with an imaging swath greater than
            150 miles (240 km). This design permits complete global coverage every 12-days, allowing researchers to
            create time-series interferometric imagery and systematically map the changing surface of Earth. The
            satellite will be three-axis stabilized, that is, using reaction wheels that rotate to keep it correctly
            oriented to Earth and Sun. It will be launched into a polar Sun-synchronous dawn-dusk orbit (crossing the
            poles, trailing Earth's shadow to remain in a perpetual sunrise or sunset).

            After a 90-day commissioning period, the mission will conduct a minimum of three full years of science
            operations with the L-band radar to satisfy NASA’s requirements, while ISRO requires five years of
            operations with the S-band radar. If the system does not use all its fuel reserves during the mission,
            operations may be extended further for either radar instrument.</p>

        <h2 class="h-secondary center">Planned Launch Date: 2024</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) Mission will measure Earth’s changing ecosystems, dynamic
            surfaces, and ice masses providing information about biomass, natural hazards, sea level rise, and
            groundwater, and will support a host of other applications.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            NISAR will observe Earth’s land and ice-covered surfaces globally with 12-day regularity on ascending and
            descending passes, sampling Earth on average every 6 days for a baseline 3-year mission.
